# Java Logging Example Project

This Java project demonstrates how to implement and use the `java.util.logging` package for logging purposes. It includes examples of custom logging handlers, formatters, and filters, as well as how to configure logging settings externally using a `logging.properties` file.

## Features

- Use of `java.util.logging` for application logging
- External logging configuration through `logging.properties`
- Custom logging handler, formatter, and filter implementations
- Example of programmatically loading logging configurations

## Prerequisites

- Java JDK 8 or later
- Gradle (This project uses Gradle for building and dependency management)

## Getting Started

### Clone the Repository

First, clone this repository to your local machine using Git:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/alphaolomi/java-logging-example.git
cd java-logging-example
```

### Project Structure

The project follows the standard Gradle project layout:

```
java-logging-example/
├── src/
│   ├── main/
│   │   ├── java/
│   │   │   └── com/alphaolomi/
│   │   │       └── LoggingExample.java
│   │   └── resources/
│   │       └── logging.properties
│   └── test/
├── build.gradle
└── README.md
```

### Configuration

The logging behavior can be customized by editing the `src/main/resources/logging.properties` file. This file is automatically loaded into the application's classpath and read by the `java.util.logging` framework at runtime.

### Building the Project

To compile the project and generate a JAR file, run the following command from the root of the project:

```sh
gradle build
```

The build artifacts will be stored in the `build/libs` directory.

### Running the Application

After building, you can run the application using the following command:

```sh
java -jar build/libs/java-logging-1.0-SNAPSHOT.jar 
```

Replace `java-logging-example-1.0.jar` with the actual name of the JAR file generated by Gradle.

## Custom Logging Handler, Formatter, and Filter

The project includes examples of a custom logging handler (`MyHandler`), a formatter (`MyFormatter`), and a filter (`MyFilter`). These are defined within the `LoggingExample.java` file and demonstrate how to extend the logging capabilities provided by `java.util.logging`.
